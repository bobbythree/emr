## Electronic Medical Records (EMR) Software  

### In an effort to improve the user experience of EMRs, I have decided to build my own from scratch. The aim is to have fast load times and ease of use. This is a work in progress.  

## To run:  
### clone this repo to your local machine and run  
 ```npm install```  
###  followed by  
  ```npm run dev```  
###  from the root directory
